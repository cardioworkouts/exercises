Alternate high intensity and low intensity periods: The key to a successful HIIT workout is alternating between periods of high intensity exercise and periods of low intensity or rest. You can do this by adjusting the speed and incline of the treadmill.</p><p>3. Use the incline: Adding incline to your treadmill workout can increase the intensity and help you burn more calories. Try doing intervals at a high incline for added challenge.</p><p>4. Mix it up: Don't be afraid to mix up your HIIT workouts. You can try different speeds, inclines, and even add in some strength training exercises like lunges or squats.</p><h3>Specific Workouts for Best High Intensity Interval Training on Treadmill</h3><p>1. Sprint intervals: Alternate between 30 seconds of sprinting at a high speed and 30 seconds of rest or walking at a low speed. Repeat for 10-15 minutes.</p><p>2. Hill intervals: Alternate between periods of running or walking at a high incline and periods of rest or walking at a low incline. Repeat for 10-15 minutes.</p><h4>How to stay safe during high intensity interval training on treadmill?</h4><p>While high intensity interval training on a treadmill can be a great way to get in shape, it's important to stay safe. Here are some tips:</p><p>1. Start slow: If you're new to HIIT, start with shorter intervals and lower speeds. Gradually increase the intensity as your fitness level improves.</p><p>2. Listen to your body: If you feel pain or discomfort during your workout, slow down or stop. It's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard.</p><p>3.
