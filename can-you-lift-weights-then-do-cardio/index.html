If yes, then you are not alone. Many people are confused about whether they should lift weights or do cardio first in their workout routine. In this blog post, we will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of lifting weights and doing cardio in the same workout session. We will also answer the frequently asked question, can you lift weights then do cardio?</p><p>For many people, the idea of doing both weightlifting and cardio in the same workout session can be overwhelming. This is because both types of exercises require a lot of energy and focus. Additionally, if you do not plan your workout correctly, you may end up feeling exhausted and not getting the desired results. </p><h2>Can You Lift Weights Then Do Cardio?</h2><p>The answer is yes; you can lift weights and then do cardio. In fact, doing both exercises can help you achieve your fitness goals faster. However, the order in which you perform these exercises is crucial. If you want to build muscle mass and strength, lift weights first and then do cardio. On the other hand, if you want to improve your cardiovascular fitness, do cardio first, and then lift weights.</p><p>In general, lifting weights before cardio is more beneficial because it allows you to focus on your strength training without being fatigued. Additionally, it ensures that your muscles have enough glycogen stores to perform the exercises effectively. On the other hand, if you do cardio first, you risk depleting your glycogen stores, which can lead to decreased exercise performance and muscle fatigue.</p><h2>My Personal Experience with Lifting Weights and Doing Cardio</h2><p>As a fitness enthusiast, I have tried both lifting weights and doing cardio in the same workout session. Initially, I used to do cardio first and then lift weights. However, I noticed that I was not able to lift as heavy as I wanted to, and my muscles felt fatigued quickly. I then decided to switch my routine and started lifting weights first and then doing cardio. The results were amazing. I was able to lift heavier weights, and my muscles felt less fatigued during the workout. </p><h2>The Benefits of Lifting Weights Then Doing Cardio</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, lifting weights before cardio has many benefits. Some of these include:</p><ul><li>Improved muscle strength and size</li><li>Better endurance and increased cardiovascular fitness</li><li>Increased fat burning and weight loss</li><li>Reduced risk of injury</li></ul><h3>Improved Muscle Strength and Size</h3><p>Lifting weights before cardio allows you to focus on your strength training without being fatigued. This means that you can lift heavier weights and perform more reps, which can lead to improved muscle strength and size.</p><h3>Better Endurance and Increased Cardiovascular Fitness</h3><p>Lifting weights before cardio can also improve your endurance and cardiovascular fitness. When you lift weights, your heart rate increases, and your body burns calories. This prepares your body for the cardio session, allowing you to perform better and for a longer time.</p><h3>Increased Fat Burning and Weight Loss</h3><p>Another benefit of lifting weights before cardio is increased fat burning and weight loss. Lifting weights helps to build muscle mass, which increases your metabolism. This means that you burn more calories even when you are not exercising. Additionally, doing cardio after lifting weights can help you burn more fat as your glycogen stores are depleted.</p><h3>Reduced Risk of Injury</h3><p>Lifting weights before cardio can also reduce your risk of injury. This is because when you lift weights, your muscles and joints are warm and ready for exercise. This reduces the risk of strains, sprains, and other injuries that can occur during a workout.</p><h2>How to Incorporate Lifting Weights and Cardio in Your Workout Routine</h2><p>If you want to incorporate lifting weights and cardio in your workout routine, here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Plan your workout in advance</li><li>Lift weights first and then do cardio</li><li>Start with a warm-up session</li><li>Choose exercises that target different muscle groups</li><li>Stay hydrated</li></ul><h2>FAQs About Can You Lift Weights Then Do Cardio?</h2><h4>Q. What is the best time to do cardio after lifting weights?</h4><p>A. The best time to do cardio after lifting weights is 24 hours later. This allows your muscles to recover and prevents fatigue and injury.</p><h4>Q. Can you lose weight by lifting weights and doing cardio?</h4><p>A. Yes, you can lose weight by lifting weights and doing cardio. This is because both exercises burn calories and increase your metabolism.</p><h4>Q. How long should you wait to do cardio after lifting weights?</h4><p>A. You should wait for at least 30 minutes to do cardio after lifting weights. This allows your body to recover and replenish glycogen stores.</p><h4>Q. Can you do cardio and weights on the same day?</h4><p>A. Yes, you can do cardio and weights on the same day. However, it is essential to plan your workout and perform them in the correct order.</p><h2>Conclusion of Can You Lift Weights Then Do Cardio?</h2><p>In conclusion, lifting weights and doing cardio in the same workout session is beneficial for achieving fitness goals. However, the order in which you perform these exercises is crucial. If you want to build muscle mass and strength, lift weights first and then do cardio. On the other hand, if you want to improve your cardiovascular fitness, do cardio first and then lift weights. Remember to plan your workout in advance, stay hydrated, and choose exercises that target different muscle groups. </p></article>
