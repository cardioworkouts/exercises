However, a typical HIIT workout might include a warm-up period, followed by several rounds of high-intensity exercise and rest periods, and ending with a cool-down period.</p><p>For example, your workout might look something like this:</p><ul><li>5-minute warm-up (such as jogging or jumping jacks)</li><li>30 seconds of sprinting</li><li>30 seconds of rest</li><li>30 seconds of burpees</li><li>30 seconds of rest</li><li>30 seconds of mountain climbers</li><li>30 seconds of rest</li><li>30 seconds of squat jumps</li><li>30 seconds of rest</li><li>Repeat the above cycle 4-5 times</li><li>5-minute cool-down (such as stretching)</li></ul><h4>Tips for Getting the Most Out of Your Best HIIT Training Workout</h4><p>To get the most out of your HIIT workout, there are a few tips to keep in mind.
