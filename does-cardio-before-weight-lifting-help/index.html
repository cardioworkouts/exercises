Firstly, make sure you warm up your body with some light cardio exercises such as jogging or cycling for 10-15 minutes.

Lastly, ensure that you give your body enough time to recover between cardio and weight lifting, ideally around 10-15 minutes.</p><h4>Tips for Maximizing Results</h4><p>If you want to maximize the benefits of doing cardio before weight lifting, then you should consider the following tips:</p><ul><li>Keep the intensity low to moderate</li><li>Focus on compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups</li><li>Gradually increase your cardio duration and intensity over time</li><li>Ensure you are getting enough rest and recovery time</li></ul><h2>Personal Experience</h2><p>Personally, I have tried both approaches of doing cardio before and after weight lifting, and I have found that doing cardio before weight lifting suits me best. It helps me warm up, improves my energy levels, and helps me burn more calories. However, I ensure that I don't over-exhaust myself and take enough rest between cardio and weight lifting.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q.
