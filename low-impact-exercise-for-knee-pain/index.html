It can be a frustrating and debilitating condition that can limit your mobility and affect your quality of life. Fortunately, low impact exercises can help alleviate pain and improve mobility, without putting excess strain on your knees.</p><p>The target of low impact exercise for knee pain is to strengthen the muscles surrounding the knee joint, improve flexibility, and promote healthy blood flow to the area.

By incorporating these exercises into your routine, you can strengthen your muscles, improve flexibility, and reduce pain. Let's take a closer look at some of the best low impact exercises for knee pain.</p><h2>The Benefits of Walking</h2><p>Walking is one of the best low impact exercises you can do for knee pain.

It's a full-body workout that's easy on your joints, making it ideal for those with knee pain. Swimming can help improve cardiovascular health, increase muscle strength and flexibility, and reduce stress on the knee joint.</p><p>Personally, I've found that swimming has been a great way to stay active and reduce knee pain. I try to swim at least once a week, and I've noticed a significant improvement in my knee pain and overall function. When swimming, be sure to use proper form and technique to avoid putting excess strain on your knees.</p><h3>Pilates for Knee Pain</h3><p>Pilates is a low impact exercise that can be extremely helpful for those with knee pain.
