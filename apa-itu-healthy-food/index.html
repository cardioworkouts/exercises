If you're someone who's unsure about what healthy food is, you're not alone. Many people struggle with understanding what constitutes healthy food and what they should be eating to maintain a healthy diet.</p><p>One of the main pain points related to healthy food is that people often associate it with bland and boring meals.

It's food that provides the nutrients and energy that your body needs to function properly. Healthy food is also food that doesn't contain harmful substances such as excessive amounts of sugar, salt, or unhealthy fats. By eating healthy food, you can maintain a healthy weight, reduce your risk of chronic diseases, and improve your overall wellbeing.</p><p>In summary, healthy food is food that is good for your body and doesn't contain harmful substances.
