Then, push back up to the starting position.</p><h3>Plank</h3><p>The plank is a great exercise for strengthening your core. To perform a plank, start in a push-up position and then lower your forearms to the ground. Your body should form a straight line from your head to your toes. Hold this position for as long as you can.</p><h3>Lunges</h3><p>Lunges are another great lower body exercise that work your quads, glutes, and hamstrings.
