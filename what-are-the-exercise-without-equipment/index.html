Lower your body until your chest touches the ground, and then push back up to the starting position.</p><h3>Squats</h3><p>Squats are a great lower body exercise that work your glutes, quads, and hamstrings. To perform a squat, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing forward. Lower yourself down as if you were sitting in a chair, keeping your back straight and your knees behind your toes. Then, push back up to the starting position.</p><h3>Plank</h3><p>The plank is a great exercise for strengthening your core. To perform a plank, start in a push-up position and then lower your forearms to the ground. Your body should form a straight line from your head to your toes. Hold this position for as long as you can.</p><h3>Lunges</h3><p>Lunges are another great lower body exercise that work your quads, glutes, and hamstrings. To perform a lunge, take a big step forward with one foot and lower your body until your back knee almost touches the ground. Then, push back up to the starting position and repeat with the other leg.</p><h3>Mountain Climbers</h3><p>Mountain climbers are a great exercise for your entire body, but particularly your core and shoulders. To perform a mountain climber, start in a plank position and then bring one knee up to your chest. Quickly switch legs and repeat for as long as you can.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><h4>Q: How often should I do exercises without equipment?</h4><p>A: It is recommended that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week.
