Try to touch your chest to the bar and then slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position.</p><p><h2>Chin-Ups</h2></p><p>Chin-ups are similar to pull-ups but they target your biceps more than your lats. To do a chin-up, grip the bar with your palms facing towards you and your hands shoulder-width apart. Pull yourself up towards the bar, keeping your elbows close to your body, and touch your chin to the bar. Then, slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position.</p><p><h2>Inverted Rows</h2></p><p>Inverted rows are another great exercise for working out your lats.

Keep your body in a straight line and pull yourself up towards the bar or rings, keeping your elbows close to your body. Then, slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position.</p><p><h2>Superman</h2></p><p>The superman exercise is a great way to work out your lats and your lower back muscles. To do the superman exercise, lie face down on the ground with your arms extended in front of you. Lift your arms and legs up off the ground as high as you can and hold the position for a few seconds. Then, slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position.</p><p>These are just a few of the many exercises you can do to workout your lats at home without equipment.
