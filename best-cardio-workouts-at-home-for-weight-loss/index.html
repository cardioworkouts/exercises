This helps to keep my heart rate up and burn more calories.</p><p><h3>Burpees</h3></p><p>Burpees are another great cardio exercise that can be done at home. This exercise targets multiple muscle groups and can help to burn calories quickly. It also helps to improve your strength and endurance levels.</p><p>Personally, I like to do burpees in between my jumping jacks and mountain climbers.
