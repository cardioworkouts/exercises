Not only have I seen significant improvements in my physical appearance, but I have also experienced an increase in energy levels and overall well-being.Cardio exercise has helped me burn calories and lose weight, but it has also improved my endurance and stamina. I can now run farther and faster than I ever could before. Weight lifting has helped me build muscle and improve my overall strength, which has made everyday activities easier and more enjoyable.When done together, cardio and weight lifting can help you achieve your fitness goals faster than if you were to do them separately. Cardio helps you burn calories and lose weight, while weight lifting helps you build muscle and boost your metabolism. This combination can lead to a leaner, stronger, and healthier body.How to Incorporate Cardio and Weight Lifting into Your RoutineIf you&#39;re new to cardio and weight lifting, it&#39;s important to start slow and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts. Aim to do cardio exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, five days a week. For weight lifting, start with light weights and focus on mastering proper form before increasing the weight.It&#39;s also important to incorporate rest days into your routine to allow your body time to recover and repair. This will help prevent injury and ensure that you&#39;re able to continue exercising for years to come.Question and AnswerQ: Is it better to do cardio or weight lifting first?A: It&#39;s generally recommended to do weight lifting first, as it requires more energy and focus than cardio.
