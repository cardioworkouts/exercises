You can break this up into shorter sessions throughout the day if necessary. For example, you could do 15 minutes of jogging in the morning and 15 minutes of cycling in the evening.</p><h2>Strength Training</h2><p>Strength training is an essential part of any aerobic exercise plan for a week brainly.
