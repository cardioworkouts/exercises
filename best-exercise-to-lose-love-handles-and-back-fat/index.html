Planks are easy to do at home and require no equipment, making them a convenient option for anyone. To do a plank, start in a push-up position and then lower yourself down so that you're resting on your forearms. Your body should form a straight line from your head to your heels.

Hold this position for a few seconds, then switch sides and repeat. Bird dogs target your core and back muscles, helping to build strength and definition in these areas.</p><p><h3>Other Effective Exercises for Love Handles and Back Fat</h3></p><p>In addition to planks and bird dogs, there are plenty of other exercises that can help you lose love handles and back fat.

Bend forward at the hips, keeping your back straight, and let your arms hang straight down towards the ground. Then, pull the dumbbells up towards your chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together. Lower the dumbbells back down and repeat for several reps.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How often should I do these exercises to see results?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Aim to do these exercises at least 3-4 times per week, with a rest day in between each session.
