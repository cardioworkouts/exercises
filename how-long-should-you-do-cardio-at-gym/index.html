This type of workout is great for improving cardiovascular endurance and burning calories.</p><p><h4>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</h4></p><p>HIIT involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by periods of rest. This type of workout is great for burning calories and improving cardiovascular fitness in a shorter amount of time.</p><p><h2>Listen to Your Body</h2></p><p>It's important to listen to your body when it comes to cardio. If you're feeling tired or sore, take a rest day or decrease the intensity of your workout.
