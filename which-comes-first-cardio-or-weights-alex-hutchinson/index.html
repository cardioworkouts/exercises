Fitness Myths, Training Truths</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Are you confused about whether to do cardio or weights first during your workout? Do you wonder which one is more effective? Well, you are not alone in this dilemma. Many people are unsure whether cardio or weights should be their top priority. In this blog post, we will explore the topic of which comes first cardio or weights, with the help of Alex Hutchinson, a renowned sports scientist and author.</p><p>Working out can be a daunting task, especially if you are not sure what to do first. Many people struggle with this decision, and it can lead to frustration and confusion. Some people prefer cardio, while others prefer weight training. The truth is, both are essential for overall fitness and health, but the order in which you do them can make a significant difference in your results.</p><p>Alex Hutchinson, a sports scientist, and author, has done extensive research on this topic. According to him, the order in which you do cardio and weights depends on your fitness goals. If your goal is to build muscle mass, then weight training should be your top priority. However, if your goal is to improve cardiovascular health or lose weight, then cardio should come first.</p><p>In summary, if you are looking to build muscle mass, start with weight training before cardio. But, if you want to improve your cardiovascular health or lose weight, begin with cardio before weight training.</p><h2>My Personal Experience with Which Comes First Cardio or Weights - Alex Hutchinson</h2><p>As someone who enjoys working out, I struggled with this decision for a long time. I used to do cardio first, followed by weight training, but I felt like I was not getting the results I wanted. However, after reading Alex Hutchinson's book, "Which Comes First Cardio or Weights?," I realized that I was doing it wrong.</p><p>Now, I start my workout with a 10-minute warm-up on the treadmill, followed by weight training for 45 minutes, and then finish with 20 minutes of cardio. This routine has helped me build muscle mass while improving my cardiovascular health.</p><h2>The Science Behind Which Comes First Cardio or Weights - Alex Hutchinson</h2><p>Alex Hutchinson's research has shown that doing cardio before weight training can reduce your strength and power during weight training. However, if you do weight training first, you will have more energy and strength for the workout, resulting in better muscle growth and strength gains.</p><p>On the other hand, starting with cardio can help improve your endurance and burn more calories during your workout. This is beneficial for those who are trying to lose weight or improve their cardiovascular health.</p><h3>Tips for Doing Cardio and Weights</h3><p>If you are new to working out, it can be challenging to know where to start. Here are some tips for doing cardio and weights:</p><ul><li>Warm-up before starting your workout.</li><li>Start with compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups.</li><li>Focus on proper form and technique.</li><li>Gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workout.</li><li>Take rest days to allow your muscles to recover.</li></ul><h4>How to Incorporate Cardio and Weights into Your Workout</h4><p>If you are unsure how to incorporate cardio and weights into your workout, here is an example routine:</p><ul><li>Warm-up for 10 minutes on the treadmill or elliptical machine.</li><li>Do weight training for 45 minutes, focusing on compound exercises such as squats, deadlifts, and bench press.</li><li>Finish with 20-30 minutes of cardio on the treadmill, elliptical, or stationary bike.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion of Which Comes First Cardio or Weights - Alex Hutchinson</h2><p>In conclusion, whether you do cardio or weights first depends on your fitness goals. If you are looking to build muscle mass, start with weight training before cardio. But, if you want to improve your cardiovascular health or lose weight, begin with cardio before weight training. Remember to warm-up before your workout, focus on proper form and technique, and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workout. With these tips, you can achieve your fitness goals and stay healthy.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><h3>Q1. What should I do first, cardio or weights?</h3><p>A1. It depends on your fitness goals.
