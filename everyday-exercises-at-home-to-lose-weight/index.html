Squats</h2></p><p>When it comes to everyday exercises at home to lose weight, squats are one of the most effective exercises. They work your entire lower body, including your glutes, quads, hamstrings, and calves. To perform a squat, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, bend your knees, and lower your hips down as if you were sitting in a chair. Make sure to keep your back straight and your chest up.

They work your glutes, quads, and hamstrings while also engaging your core for stability. To perform a lunge, step forward with one foot and lower your back knee down toward the ground. Make sure to keep your front knee directly above your ankle and your back knee hovering just above the ground. Then, push back up to a standing position and repeat on the other side. Aim for 3 sets of 10-15 reps on each leg.</p><p><h3>3. Plank</h3></p><p>A plank is a simple yet effective exercise for strengthening your core muscles. To perform a plank, get into a push-up position with your hands directly below your shoulders and your feet together. Then, lower your body down onto your forearms and hold this position for 30-60 seconds. Make sure to keep your core engaged and your back straight. Repeat for 3 sets.</p><p><h4>4. Jumping Jacks</h4></p><p>Jumping jacks are a classic cardio exercise that can help you burn calories and increase your heart rate. To perform a jumping jack, start with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Then, jump your feet out to the sides while raising your arms above your head. Jump back to the starting position and repeat for 3 sets of 20-30 reps.</p><p><h2>5. Yoga</h2></p><p>Yoga is a great way to improve your flexibility, balance, and overall well-being.
