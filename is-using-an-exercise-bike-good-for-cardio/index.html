Once you're set up, start pedaling at a moderate pace. Increase the resistance as you get more comfortable and aim to maintain a consistent pace for at least 20-30 minutes.</p><p>During your workout, keep your core engaged and your shoulders relaxed. Focus on your breathing, taking deep breaths in through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.
