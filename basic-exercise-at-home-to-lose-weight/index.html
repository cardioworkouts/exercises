Then, push through your hands to lift your body back up. Repeat for several reps.</p><h3>Planks</h3><p>Planks are a simple exercise that can help you build core strength and stability. To do a plank, start in a push-up position with your arms straight and your hands shoulder-width apart. Lower your body down onto your forearms, keeping your body straight. Hold for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then release.</p><h4>Jumping Jacks</h4><p>Jumping jacks are a great way to get your heart rate up and burn calories.
