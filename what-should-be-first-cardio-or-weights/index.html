ATeam Fitness</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Are you confused about whether you should do cardio or weights first during your workout session? It's a common question that many gym-goers have. In this post, we'll discuss the benefits of both cardio and weight training and which one you should prioritize first.</p><p>Many people struggle with choosing between cardio and weights because they don't know which one to start with. It's a pain point that can lead to frustration and confusion, especially for beginners who want to optimize their workout routines.</p><p>The answer to the question of what should be first cardio or weights is: it depends on your fitness goals. If your primary goal is to lose weight, then starting with cardio is ideal. However, if you want to build muscle and strength, then starting with weights is a better option.</p><p>To summarize, both cardio and weights are essential for overall fitness, but which one you prioritize first depends on your fitness goals. In this post, we'll dive deeper into the benefits of both cardio and weight training and how to incorporate them into your workout routine.</p><h2>Cardio First</h2><p>If your primary goal is to lose weight and burn fat, then starting with cardio is ideal. Cardio exercises such as running, cycling, and rowing help in burning calories and increase your heart rate, which leads to weight loss. When you perform cardio exercises before weights, you'll have more energy to perform cardio and burn more calories.</p><p>Personally, I prefer starting my workout with 20-30 minutes of cardio on the treadmill or elliptical machine. It helps me warm up my body and get my heart rate up before diving into weight training.</p><h2>Weights First</h2><p>If your primary goal is to build muscle and strength, then starting with weights is ideal. Weight training increases muscle mass, improves bone density, and strengthens connective tissue, which leads to better overall health. When you perform weight training before cardio, you'll have more energy to perform heavy lifts and build more muscle.</p><p>Personally, I prefer starting my workout with weight training, focusing on compound lifts such as squats, deadlifts, and bench press. It helps me build strength and muscle before diving into cardio.</p><h3>The Benefits of Cardio</h3><p>Cardio exercises have numerous benefits for overall health. They help in reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Cardio also increases lung capacity, improves endurance, and boosts mood by releasing endorphins.</p><p>When you do cardio exercises, your body burns calories, which leads to weight loss. Cardio also helps in reducing body fat percentage, which leads to a leaner physique.</p><h4>The Benefits of Weight Training</h4><p>Weight training also has numerous benefits for overall health. It increases muscle mass, improves bone density, and strengthens connective tissue. Weight training also boosts metabolism, which leads to weight loss.</p><p>When you do weight training, your body burns calories even after the workout is over. This is known as the afterburn effect or excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC).</p><h2>How to Incorporate Cardio and Weight Training into Your Workout Routine</h2><p>The best way to incorporate cardio and weight training into your workout routine is to create a balanced program that fits your fitness goals. If your primary goal is weight loss, then you can start with 20-30 minutes of cardio, followed by weight training. If your primary goal is muscle building, then you can start with weight training, followed by 20-30 minutes of cardio.</p><p>It's essential to listen to your body and adjust your workout routine accordingly. If you feel fatigued, take a rest day or reduce the intensity of your workout. It's better to have a consistent workout routine than to push yourself too hard and end up injuring yourself.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><h3>Q: Can I do cardio and weight training on the same day?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can do cardio and weight training on the same day. It's essential to prioritize the exercise that aligns with your fitness goals first.</p><h3>Q: How long should I do cardio and weight training for?</h3><p>A: It depends on your fitness goals and fitness level. If you're a beginner, start with 20-30 minutes of cardio and weight training. As you progress, you can increase the duration and intensity of your workout.</p><h3>Q: Should I do cardio or weights first if I don't have a specific fitness goal?</h3><p>A: It's best to alternate between cardio and weight training. You can start with 20-30 minutes of cardio, followed by weight training on one day, and vice versa on the next day.</p><h3>Q: How many times a week should I do cardio and weight training?</h3><p>A: It depends on your fitness goals and fitness level. If you're a beginner, start with two to three days of cardio and weight training. As you progress, you can increase the frequency and intensity of your workout.</p><h2>Conclusion of What Should Be First: Cardio or Weights</h2><p>In conclusion, whether you should start with cardio or weights depends on your fitness goals. If your primary goal is to lose weight, then starting with cardio is ideal. However, if you want to build muscle and strength, then starting with weights is a better option. Both cardio and weights are essential for overall fitness, so it's best to incorporate them into your workout routine. Remember to listen to your body and adjust your workout routine accordingly to prevent injury and have a consistent workout routine.</p></article>
