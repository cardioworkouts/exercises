It depends on several factors, including your fitness goals, current fitness level, and overall health. For some people, doing cardio and weights every day can be an effective way to achieve their fitness goals. However, for others, it may not be the best approach.</p><h2>Summary of Main Points</h2><p>In summary, the decision to do cardio and weights every day depends on your individual needs and goals.
