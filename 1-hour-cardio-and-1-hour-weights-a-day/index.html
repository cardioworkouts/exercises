Do you want to lose weight and build muscle, but don't know where to start? Finding the right balance between cardio and weights can be a daunting task, but with 1 hour cardio and 1 hour weights a day, you can achieve the results you want.</p><p>Many people believe that cardio is the only way to lose weight, while others think that weights are only for bodybuilders.

Mixing up your routine will keep things interesting and prevent boredom.</p><p><h4>4. Listen to your body.</h4></p><p>If you're feeling tired or sore, take a rest day.
