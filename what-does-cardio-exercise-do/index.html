This increased endurance has also helped me in other areas of my fitness routine, such as weight lifting, where I am now able to perform more repetitions without feeling as fatigued.</p><p><h2>Cardio Exercise and Mental Health</h2></p><p>In addition to physical benefits, cardio exercise can also have a positive impact on mental health. Regular cardio workouts can help to reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood, and boost self-esteem. Personally, I have found that going for a run or attending a cardio-focused fitness class can be a great way to clear my mind and improve my overall mood.</p><p><h3>How Often Should You Do Cardio Exercise?</h3></p><p>It is recommended that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity cardio exercise per week. This can be broken down into 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, five days a week, or 25 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise, three days a week. It is important to find a routine that works for you and to gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts over time.</p><p><h4>Tips for Incorporating Cardio Exercise Into Your Routine</h4></p><p>If you are new to cardio exercise, it can be helpful to start with low-impact activities such as walking or cycling. As you become more comfortable, you can gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts. It can also be helpful to find a workout buddy or join a fitness class to stay motivated and accountable.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of What Does Cardio Exercise Do</h2></p><p>In conclusion, cardio exercise has numerous benefits for both physical and mental health. By incorporating cardio into your routine, you can improve heart health, increase endurance, aid in weight loss, and reduce stress and anxiety. Remember to start slow and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts, finding a routine that works best for you.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can cardio exercise help to prevent chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, regular cardio exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is it better to do cardio before or after weight lifting?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> It is generally recommended to do cardio after weight lifting, as weight lifting can deplete energy stores needed for cardio exercise.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you do cardio exercise every day?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it is safe to do cardio exercise every day as long as you vary the intensity and duration of your workouts to allow for proper recovery.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How long does it take to see results from cardio exercise?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> The amount of time it takes to see results from cardio exercise can vary based on factors such as intensity, duration, and frequency of workouts.
