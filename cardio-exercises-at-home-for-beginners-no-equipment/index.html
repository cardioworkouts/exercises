As you get comfortable, increase the time and sets.</p><p><h4>Mountain Climbers</h4></p><p>Mountain climbers are a great way to work your core, arms, and legs.

As you get comfortable, increase the time and sets.</p><p><h2>Staying Motivated</h2></p><p>Staying motivated can be one of the biggest challenges for beginners.
