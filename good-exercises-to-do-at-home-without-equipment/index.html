Here&#039;s 20 No Equipment Workouts You Can Do At Home</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p></p><p>Are you tired of going to the gym or unable to afford a gym membership? Do you want to stay fit and healthy without having to leave your house? If so, you're in luck! There are plenty of good exercises to do at home without equipment that can help you stay in shape.</p><p>Working out at home can be challenging, especially if you're used to the gym environment. It's easy to get distracted or lose motivation when you're in your own space. However, with the right mindset and a few good exercises, you can make your home workout just as effective as a gym session.</p><p>So, what are some good exercises to do at home without equipment? There are several options that target different muscle groups and can be done in a small space. These exercises include bodyweight squats, push-ups, planks, lunges, and burpees. You can also incorporate cardio by doing jumping jacks, mountain climbers, or high knees.</p><p>In summary, good exercises to do at home without equipment include bodyweight squats, push-ups, planks, lunges, burpees, jumping jacks, mountain climbers, and high knees. These exercises target different muscle groups and can help you stay in shape even without any equipment.</p><p><h2>Bodyweight Squats</h2></p><p>Bodyweight squats are a great exercise to do at home because they target your lower body and don't require any equipment. To do a bodyweight squat, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing forward. Lower your body down by bending your knees and pushing your hips back. Keep your chest up and your weight in your heels. Pause for a moment at the bottom and then push back up to the starting position. Repeat for 10-15 reps.</p><p><h2>Push-Ups</h2></p><p>Push-ups are another good exercise to do at home that target your chest, triceps, and shoulders. To do a push-up, start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart and your feet together. Lower your body down by bending your elbows and keeping your core tight. Push back up to the starting position and repeat for 10-15 reps.</p><p><h3>Planks</h3></p><p>Planks are an excellent exercise to do at home that targets your core muscles. To do a plank, start in a push-up position and then lower your body down so that your forearms are on the ground. Keep your body in a straight line from your head to your feet and hold for 30-60 seconds.</p><p><h4>Lunges</h4></p><p>Lunges are a great exercise to do at home that target your legs and glutes. To do a lunge, start by standing with your feet hip-width apart. Take a big step forward with your left foot and lower your body down until your left knee is at a 90-degree angle. Your right knee should be hovering just above the ground. Push back up to the starting position and repeat with your right foot. Do 10-15 reps on each leg.</p><p><h2>Burpees</h2></p><p>Burpees are a challenging exercise to do at home that targets your entire body. To do a burpee, start in a standing position and then lower your body down into a squat. Kick your feet back into a plank position and then do a push-up. Jump your feet back up to your hands and then jump up into the air. Repeat for 10-15 reps.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How many reps should I do for each exercise?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Aim for 10-15 reps for each exercise, and then repeat for 2-3 sets.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How often should I do these exercises?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Aim to do these exercises 2-3 times per week, or more if you can.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I modify these exercises if I'm a beginner?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can modify these exercises by doing fewer reps or doing a modified version of the exercise. For example, you can do push-ups on your knees or do a half squat instead of a full squat.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I add weights to these exercises to make them more challenging?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can add weights to these exercises if you have them. For example, you can hold a dumbbell or a water bottle during lunges or squats to make them more challenging.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Good Exercises to Do at Home Without Equipment</h2></p><p>Working out at home can be just as effective as going to the gym if you have the right mindset and good exercises to do. Bodyweight squats, push-ups, planks, lunges, burpees, jumping jacks, mountain climbers, and high knees are all good exercises to do at home without equipment. Incorporating these exercises into your routine can help you stay in shape and improve your overall health and fitness.</p></article>
