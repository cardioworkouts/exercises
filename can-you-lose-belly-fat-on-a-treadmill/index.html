Explained</h2><p>Before we delve deeper into the topic, let's first understand what belly fat is and how it accumulates. Belly fat, also known as visceral fat, is the fat stored around the abdominal organs. This type of fat is harmful and increases the risk of various health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.</p><p>The accumulation of belly fat is the result of an imbalance between energy intake (calories consumed) and energy expenditure (calories burned). When you consume more calories than your body needs, the excess calories are stored as fat. And when you burn fewer calories than you consume, the excess calories are also stored as fat.</p><p>Therefore, to lose belly fat, you need to create a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than your body needs or burning more calories than you consume. A treadmill workout can help you burn calories and create a calorie deficit, which can lead to belly fat loss.</p><h2>My Personal Experience with Treadmill Workout</h2><p>As a fitness enthusiast, I have tried various workouts to lose belly fat.
