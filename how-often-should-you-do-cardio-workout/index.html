<meta name="description" content="How often should you do cardio to build endurance and improve healthAre you confused about how often you should do cardio workout? Do you want to know the right frequency for your cardio exercises? If yes, then you&#39;re in the right place.

Most people want to know the ideal frequency to maximize the benefits of their cardio exercises.

You can use a fitness app or a journal to document your workouts, including the type of exercise, duration, and intensity. This will help you track your progress, adjust your workout routine accordingly, and stay motivated.</p><p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2></p><p>In conclusion, the ideal frequency for cardio workout depends on several factors such as age, fitness level, health status, and training goals. However, a general guideline is to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week.
