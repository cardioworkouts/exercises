Chelsea&#039;s Fit Life</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p></p><p>Are you confused about whether to start with cardio or weights during your workout? It's a common question and can be a bit confusing for beginners. This blog post will help you understand which one you should start with for weight loss and why.</p><p>When it comes to weight loss, both cardio and weight training are important. Cardio helps you burn calories and lose weight, while weight training helps you build muscle mass, which in turn helps you burn more calories even when you're not exercising. So, it's essential to include both in your workout routine. But the question is, which one should you start with?</p><p>The answer is, it depends on your fitness goals. If your goal is to build muscle mass and increase strength, you should start with weight training. On the other hand, if your goal is to lose weight, you should start with cardio.</p><p>In short, if you want to lose weight, you should start with cardio. Cardio will help you burn calories and fat, which will lead to weight loss. Weight training should come after cardio as it will help you build muscle mass and increase metabolism, which will help you burn more calories in the long run.</p><p><h2>Personal Experience</h2></p><p>As someone who has struggled with weight loss, I have tried different workout routines to achieve my fitness goals. Initially, I used to start with weight training as I believed it would help me lose weight faster. But I was wrong. I noticed that I was not burning enough calories during my workout and was not losing weight as fast as I wanted. So, I switched to starting with cardio, and it made a significant difference. I started burning more calories during my workout, and I could see the weight loss results faster. So, if your goal is to lose weight, cardio is the way to go.</p><p><h2>The Importance of Weight Training</h2></p><p>Although cardio is essential for weight loss, weight training is equally important. Building muscle mass helps you burn more calories even when you're not exercising. Muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue, so the more muscle mass you have, the more calories you'll burn. Additionally, weight training helps you tone your muscles and improve your overall body composition.</p><p><h3>How to Incorporate Both Cardio and Weight Training in Your Workout Routine?</h3></p><p>Now that you know that both cardio and weight training are necessary for weight loss, the next question is, how to incorporate both in your workout routine? A good way to do it is to start with 10-15 minutes of cardio, followed by 20-30 minutes of weight training, and then finish with another 10-15 minutes of cardio. This way, you'll get the benefits of both cardio and weight training.</p><p><h4>What are the Best Cardio and Weight Training Exercises for Weight Loss?</h4></p><p>Some of the best cardio exercises for weight loss include running, cycling, swimming, and HIIT workouts. These exercises help you burn a lot of calories and fat. For weight training, exercises like squats, deadlifts, lunges, and bench press are great for building muscle mass and increasing strength.</p><p><h2>Personal Experience</h2></p><p>As someone who has incorporated both cardio and weight training in my workout routine, I have noticed significant changes in my body composition. My muscles are more toned, and my overall body fat percentage has decreased. Additionally, I have more energy and feel stronger.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I do cardio and weight training on the same day?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can do cardio and weight training on the same day. Just make sure to give your body enough rest and recovery time.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How often should I do cardio and weight training?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> It depends on your fitness goals and workout routine. Ideally, you should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio and 2-3 days of weight training per week.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Should I do cardio before or after weight training?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> If your goal is to lose weight, you should start with cardio and then do weight training. If your goal is to build muscle mass, you should start with weight training and then do cardio.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I lose weight with weight training alone?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Weight training alone may help you build muscle mass, but it may not be enough to lose weight. Cardio is essential for weight loss as it helps you burn calories and fat.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of For Weight Loss Should You Do Cardio or Weights First</h2></p><p>In conclusion, both cardio and weight training are essential for weight loss. If your goal is to lose weight, you should start with cardio and then do weight training. It's important to incorporate both in your workout routine to achieve your fitness goals. Additionally, make sure to have a well-balanced diet and get enough rest and recovery time.</p></article>
