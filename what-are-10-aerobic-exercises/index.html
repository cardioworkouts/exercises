However, some exercises may be more challenging for those with physical limitations or injuries. </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How often should I do aerobic exercises? <br><strong>A:</strong> It's recommended to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week.
