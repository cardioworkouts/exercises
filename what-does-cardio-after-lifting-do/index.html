Eric Bach Blog</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p></p><p>Are you wondering whether you should do cardio after lifting weights? Do you want to know the benefits of doing cardio after lifting? If yes, then you are in the right place. In this article, we will explain what cardio after lifting does and why it's beneficial for you.</p><p>Cardio after lifting is a great way to improve your overall fitness and health. It involves doing cardiovascular exercises such as running, cycling or swimming after you have finished your weightlifting session. The purpose of doing cardio after lifting is to burn additional calories, increase endurance, and improve cardiovascular health.</p><p>The main target of doing cardio after lifting is to burn additional calories. When you lift weights, your body burns calories, but the calorie burn doesn't stop when you put the weights down. Doing cardio after lifting increases your heart rate and keeps your metabolism elevated, which means you continue to burn calories even after your workout is over.</p><p>In summary, cardio after lifting helps to burn additional calories, increase endurance, and improve cardiovascular health. It's a great way to boost your fitness and health goals.</p><p><h2>Personal Experience: How Cardio After Lifting Helped Me</h2></p><p>As a beginner, I struggled to see results from my workouts. I was lifting weights regularly but wasn't seeing any significant changes in my body. That's when I started doing cardio after lifting. I noticed that I was burning more calories and my endurance had increased. My overall fitness level had improved, and I began to see the results of my hard work.</p><p><h2>The Benefits of Cardio After Lifting</h2></p><p>There are several benefits of doing cardio after lifting, including:</p><p><h3>1. Burns Additional Calories</h3></p><p>As we mentioned earlier, doing cardio after lifting helps to burn additional calories. This is because your heart rate is elevated, and your body is working harder to keep up with the increased demand for oxygen. The more calories you burn, the more weight you can lose.</p><p><h3>2. Increases Endurance</h3></p><p>Cardio after lifting helps to increase endurance by improving your cardiovascular health. When you do cardio, you train your heart and lungs to work more efficiently. This means that you can exercise for longer periods of time without getting tired.</p><p><h3>3. Improves Cardiovascular Health</h3></p><p>Doing cardio after lifting can improve your cardiovascular health. It helps to lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease, and increase the strength and efficiency of your heart and lungs.</p><p><h4>4. Boosts Overall Fitness Level</h4></p><p>Cardio after lifting can boost your overall fitness level by improving your strength, endurance, and cardiovascular health. This means that you can perform better in other activities and sports.</p><p><h2>Personal Experience: How Doing Cardio After Lifting Improved My Overall Fitness</h2></p><p>Before I started doing cardio after lifting, I struggled with my overall fitness. I was always tired and found it hard to keep up with my daily activities. However, after incorporating cardio into my routine, I noticed a significant improvement in my endurance and overall fitness level. I was able to perform better in my workouts and felt more energized throughout the day.</p><p><h2>What Is the Best Type of Cardio After Lifting?</h2></p><p>The best type of cardio after lifting is the one that you enjoy the most. Running, cycling, swimming, and rowing are all great options. You can also try HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) or circuit training for a more intense workout.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q: Should I do cardio before or after lifting?</strong></p><p>A: It's best to do cardio after lifting. This is because lifting weights requires more energy and strength, and doing cardio beforehand may leave you tired and unable to perform your weightlifting exercises correctly.</p><p><strong>Q: How long should I do cardio after lifting?</strong></p><p>A: The duration of your cardio workout after lifting will depend on your fitness level and goals. It's recommended to do cardio for at least 20-30 minutes.</p><p><strong>Q: How often should I do cardio after lifting?</strong></p><p>A: You can do cardio after lifting on the same day or on alternate days. It's recommended to do cardio at least 3-4 times a week.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I do cardio on rest days?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, you can do cardio on rest days. However, it's important to listen to your body and not overdo it. Your body needs rest to recover and repair.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of What Does Cardio After Lifting Do</h2></p><p>Cardio after lifting is an excellent way to improve your overall fitness and health. It helps to burn additional calories, increase endurance, and improve cardiovascular health. The best type of cardio after lifting is the one that you enjoy the most. So, try different activities and find the one that works best for you. Remember to listen to your body and not overdo it, as rest and recovery are essential for your fitness journey.</p></article>
