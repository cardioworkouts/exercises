Athelio</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Are you confused about what to do first, cardio or weights? You're not alone. This topic has been debated for years, with no clear consensus. Some people believe that cardio should always come first, while others swear by starting with weights. In this article, we'll explore the benefits of each and provide you with some guidelines to help you decide what works best for you.</p><p>One of the biggest pain points when it comes to deciding what should be done first cardio or weights is the fear of not getting the most out of your workout. You want to make sure that you're doing the right thing to reach your fitness goals. Another concern is the risk of injury. You don't want to start with weights if your body isn't warmed up, but you also don't want to do too much cardio and tire yourself out.</p><p>The short answer to the question of what should be done first cardio or weights is that it depends on your goals. If you're looking to build muscle and increase strength, then you should start with weights. If you're trying to improve cardiovascular fitness, then cardio should come first. However, there are some guidelines that can help you make the right decision.</p><p>First, consider your energy levels. If you're feeling tired, start with a low-intensity cardio exercise to warm up your body. This will help you avoid injury and prepare your muscles for weightlifting. Alternatively, if you're feeling energized, jump right into weightlifting to maximize your strength gains.</p><h2>Personal Experience with Starting with Cardio</h2><p>Personally, I prefer to start with cardio. I find that it helps me get into the right mindset for my workout and wakes up my body. I usually do a 10-15 minute warm-up on the treadmill or stationary bike before moving on to weights. This helps me avoid injury and feels like a good way to ease into my workout.</p><h2>Personal Experience with Starting with Weights</h2><p>On the other hand, some people prefer to start with weights. They feel that this helps them maximize their strength gains and get the most out of their workout. If you choose to start with weights, make sure that you warm up your body first to avoid injury.</p><h3>The Benefits of Starting with Cardio</h3><p>Starting with cardio can help you improve your cardiovascular fitness and burn calories. It can also help you get into the right mindset for your workout and prepare your body for weightlifting. Cardio exercises like running, cycling, or jumping jacks can get your heart rate up and help you warm up your muscles.</p><h4>The Benefits of Starting with Weights</h4><p>Starting with weights can help you build muscle and increase strength. It can also help you burn calories and improve your overall fitness level. Weightlifting exercises like squats, deadlifts, or bench presses can challenge your muscles and help you reach your fitness goals.</p><h2>Personal Experience with Combining Cardio and Weights</h2><p>Personally, I like to combine cardio and weights in my workouts. I usually start with a 10-15 minute warm-up on the treadmill or stationary bike, followed by weightlifting exercises. I find that this helps me get the benefits of both types of exercise and keeps my workouts interesting.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: Should I always start with cardio or weights?</strong></p><p>A: No, it depends on your goals and energy levels. If you're looking to build muscle, start with weights. If you're trying to improve cardiovascular fitness, start with cardio.</p><p><strong>Q: How long should I warm up before weightlifting?</strong></p><p>A: It depends on your fitness level and the intensity of your workout. A good rule of thumb is to warm up for 5-10 minutes with a low-intensity cardio exercise like jogging or cycling.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I do cardio and weights on the same day?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, you can. Just make sure that you warm up properly and don't overdo it. It's important to listen to your body and take breaks if you need them.</p><p><strong>Q: What are some good cardio exercises to start with?</strong></p><p>A: Some good cardio exercises to start with include walking, jogging, cycling, or jumping jacks.</p><h2>Conclusion of What Should Be Done First Cardio or Weights</h2><p>In conclusion, there's no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of what should be done first cardio or weights. It depends on your goals, energy levels, and personal preference. Experiment with different approaches to see what works best for you, and always remember to warm up properly to avoid injury.</p></article>
