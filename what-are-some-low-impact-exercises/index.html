Walking helps improve cardiovascular health, strengthens bones, and tones muscles.Personally, I enjoy walking in the park early in the morning. It helps me clear my mind and jumpstarts my day. I usually walk for 30 minutes to an hour, depending on my schedule.

It is especially beneficial for those with joint problems as it takes the pressure off your joints. Swimming helps improve cardiovascular health, builds endurance, and tones muscles.I used to swim competitively in high school, but now I just swim for leisure. I usually go to the community pool on weekends and swim for an hour or so. It&#39;s a great way to cool off during hot summer days.YogaYoga is a low impact exercise that focuses on flexibility, balance, and strength. It is also a great way to reduce stress and improve mental health. Yoga can be done at home or in a studio, and all you need is a yoga mat.Personally, I practice yoga every morning before work. I follow a 30-minute yoga routine that includes stretching and breathing exercises. It helps me feel more energized and focused throughout the day.CyclingCycling is a low impact exercise that is perfect for those who want to work on their lower body. It helps improve cardiovascular health, strengthens leg muscles, and burns calories.
