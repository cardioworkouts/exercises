Engage your core and hold the position for as long as you can, gradually increasing the time as you get stronger.2. Bicycle CrunchesBicycle crunches are a great way to target your abs and obliques.

Lift your head, shoulders, and feet off the ground, and then touch your left elbow to your right knee as you straighten your left leg. Repeat on the other side, alternating for a total of 10-20 reps.3. Russian TwistsRussian twists are another effective exercise for toning your obliques. Sit on the floor with your knees bent and your feet flat. Lean back slightly and lift your feet off the ground, balancing on your tailbone. Hold a weight or a household item like a water bottle or a book, and twist your torso from side to side, tapping the weight on the ground on either side of your body. Repeat for 10-20 reps.4.
