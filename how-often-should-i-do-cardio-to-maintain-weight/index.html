<meta name="description" content="Pin on Keto diet for beginnersAre you trying to maintain your weight but unsure about how often you should do cardio? You’re not alone. Many people struggle with finding the perfect balance between cardio and weight maintenance.The answer to the question of how often should I do cardio to maintain weight depends on many factors such as your age, weight, gender, and overall fitness level. However, there are some general guidelines you can follow.To maintain your weight, aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio exercise per week. This can be broken down into 30 minutes of exercise for five days a week. Alternatively, you can aim for 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity cardio exercise per week or a combination of moderate and vigorous exercise.In summary, to maintain your weight, aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio exercise per week, which can be broken down into 30 minutes of exercise for five days a week.Personal ExperienceWhen I was trying to maintain my weight, I found that doing cardio for 30 minutes, five times a week worked best for me.

If you’re just starting out, you may need to do less cardio to avoid injury. As you become more fit, you may need to increase the amount of cardio you do to continue to see results.Personal ExperienceI started with just 15 minutes of cardio per day when I first started working out. As I got fitter, I slowly increased the amount of cardio I did until I was doing 30 minutes, five times a week. It took time, but it paid off in the end.Question and AnswerQ: Can I do too much cardio?A: Yes, doing too much cardio can lead to overtraining and injury.
