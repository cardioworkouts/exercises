Cardio or weights first, Cardio, Online coaching</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Are you new to the gym and wondering what to do first? Should you start with cardio or weights? This is a common question among gym-goers, and it’s important to know the answer in order to achieve your fitness goals. In this article, we will discuss the benefits of both cardio and weights and help you decide which one to do first.</p><p>Going to the gym can be overwhelming, especially if you’re not sure where to start. It’s important to understand the potential challenges you may face when starting a workout routine. Some of these challenges include feeling intimidated by other gym-goers, not knowing what exercises to do, and struggling to stay motivated. </p><p>So, what should you do first at the gym: cardio or weights? The answer is that it depends on your fitness goals. If your main goal is to lose weight, then you should start with cardio. If your goal is to build muscle, then you should start with weights. </p><p>Cardio is great for burning calories and improving your cardiovascular health. It can also help boost your mood and energy levels. On the other hand, weight training is effective for building muscle and increasing your metabolism. It can also help improve your overall strength and fitness levels.</p><h2>My Personal Experience</h2><p>When I first started going to the gym, I wasn’t sure what to do first. I decided to focus on cardio because I wanted to lose weight. I would spend 30 minutes on the treadmill or elliptical and then do some light weight training. However, after a few weeks, I noticed that I wasn’t seeing the results I wanted. I was losing weight, but I wasn’t toning up like I wanted to. That’s when I decided to switch things up and start with weights. </p><p>It was challenging at first because I wasn’t used to lifting heavy weights, but I quickly started seeing results. My muscles were getting stronger, and I was toning up. I also noticed that I had more energy throughout the day. Now, I always start with weight training and then finish my workout with some cardio.</p><h2>The Benefits of Starting with Cardio</h2><p>If your main goal is to lose weight, then starting with cardio can be beneficial. Here are some of the benefits of cardio:</p><ul><li>Burns calories and helps you lose weight</li><li>Improves your cardiovascular health</li><li>Boosts your mood and energy levels</li><li>Reduces stress and anxiety</li></ul><h2>The Benefits of Starting with Weights</h2><p>If your main goal is to build muscle, then starting with weights can be beneficial. Here are some of the benefits of weight training:</p><ul><li>Builds muscle and increases your metabolism</li><li>Improves your overall strength and fitness levels</li><li>Tones your body and helps you achieve your desired physique</li><li>Reduces the risk of injury and improves your posture</li></ul><h3>How to Incorporate Both Cardio and Weights</h3><p>If you want to incorporate both cardio and weights into your workout routine, there are a few ways to do so. One option is to alternate between cardio and weight training days. For example, you could do cardio on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and then do weight training on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Another option is to do a combination of cardio and weights in one session. For example, you could start with 30 minutes of cardio and then do 30 minutes of weight training.</p><h4>Tips for Staying Motivated</h4><p>Staying motivated can be challenging when starting a new workout routine. Here are some tips to help you stay on track:</p><ul><li>Set realistic goals and track your progress</li><li>Find a workout buddy or hire a personal trainer</li><li>Mix things up and try new exercises</li><li>Reward yourself for reaching milestones</li></ul><h2>Conclusion of What to Do First at the Gym: Cardio or Weights</h2><p>Whether you choose to start with cardio or weights, it’s important to remember that consistency is key. The most important thing is to find a workout routine that works for you and stick with it. By incorporating both cardio and weights into your routine, you can achieve your fitness goals and improve your overall health and well-being.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p>Q: Is it okay to do cardio and weights on the same day?</p><p>A: Yes, it is okay to do cardio and weights on the same day. Just be sure to warm up before starting your weight training session and cool down after your cardio session. </p><p>Q: How long should I do cardio for?</p><p>A: It’s recommended to do at least 30 minutes of cardio per day, five days a week. However, you can adjust the duration and frequency based on your fitness goals and schedule.</p><p>Q: How often should I lift weights?</p><p>A: It’s recommended to lift weights at least two to three times a week, with at least one day of rest in between sessions.
