On the other hand, if you walk too long, you may end up injuring yourself or burning out too quickly.The recommended time to walk on a treadmill to burn fat is around 30-60 minutes per day, depending on your fitness level and weight loss goals. However, it&#39;s important to note that this time should be broken up into smaller sessions throughout the day to avoid burnout and injury.To effectively burn fat and lose weight, it&#39;s also important to combine your treadmill workouts with a healthy diet and strength training routine. This will help boost your metabolism and burn even more calories throughout the day.Personal ExperienceWhen I first started walking on a treadmill to burn fat, I would only walk for 20 minutes a day.

Finally, don&#39;t forget to cool down and stretch after your workout to avoid any muscle soreness or injuries.Tips for Staying MotivatedIt can be challenging to stay motivated when walking on a treadmill, especially if you&#39;re not seeing immediate results. To stay motivated, try setting realistic goals for yourself and tracking your progress.
