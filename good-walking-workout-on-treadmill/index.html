Slow down your pace and incline for the last 5-10 minutes of your workout.</p><h2>Tip #2: Set Realistic Goals</h2><p>Setting realistic goals is vital to stay motivated and achieve results. Whether you want to lose weight, improve your cardiovascular health, or tone your leg muscles, set achievable goals that you can track and measure. For example, start with a 20-minute workout and gradually increase your time, speed, or incline.</p><h2>Tip #3: Mix It Up</h2><p>Walking on a treadmill can be monotonous if you do the same workout every day. Mix it up by changing your speed, incline, or duration. You can also try interval training, which involves alternating between high-intensity and low-intensity workouts.</p><h2>Tip #4: Use Proper Form</h2><p>Using proper form while walking on a treadmill is essential to prevent injuries and get the most out of your workout. Keep your back straight, shoulders relaxed, and arms swinging naturally. Avoid gripping the handrails or leaning forward, as this can strain your neck and back.</p><h2>Conclusion of Good Walking Workout on Treadmill</h2><p>Walking on a treadmill is an excellent way to stay fit, especially if you don't have the time or resources to go outside or hit the gym.
