Look for one that contains both carbs and protein, and avoid bars with a lot of added sugar.</p><p><strong>Q: How much should I eat before a workout?</strong></p><p>A: The amount you should eat before a workout depends on your individual needs and preferences. As a general rule, aim for a meal containing carbs and protein about 1-2 hours before your workout, or a smaller snack containing both nutrients if you're short on time.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I drink coffee before my workout?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, coffee can be a good pre-workout drink as it contains caffeine, which can help boost energy and focus.
