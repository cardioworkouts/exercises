Do 10-15 reps on each leg.</p><h2>Jumping Jacks</h2><p>Jumping jacks are a great cardio exercise that can also help build strength in your legs and core. Begin with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Jump your feet out to the side while raising your arms above your head, then jump back to the starting position. Repeat for 30-60 seconds.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: Can I build muscle without equipment?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, by using your own body weight as resistance, you can build muscle and strength without equipment.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I get a full-body workout without equipment?</strong></p><p>A: Absolutely.
