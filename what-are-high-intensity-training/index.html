These are common pain points that high intensity training can address.</p><p>High intensity training, also known as HIT, is a form of exercise that involves short bursts of intense activity.

I was able to push myself harder during each workout and saw results much faster than before.</p><p>One of my favorite high intensity workouts is a Tabata-style routine, which involves performing an exercise at maximum effort for 20 seconds, followed by a 10-second rest. This cycle is repeated for eight rounds, totaling four minutes.</p><h2>How to Get Started with High Intensity Training</h2><p>If you're new to high intensity training, it's important to start slow and gradually build up your endurance. Here are some tips to get started:</p><ul><li>Consult with a doctor before starting a new exercise routine</li><li>Start with shorter workouts and gradually increase the intensity and duration</li><li>Fuel your body with healthy foods and stay hydrated</li><li>Focus on proper form to prevent injury</li><li>Listen to your body and take breaks when needed</li></ul><h2>FAQs About High Intensity Training</h2><h3>1.
