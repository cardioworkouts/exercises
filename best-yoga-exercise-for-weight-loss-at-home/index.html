My clothes started fitting better, and I had more energy throughout the day.</p><p>Sun Salutations are a great way to start your day and get your blood flowing. They consist of a series of 12 poses that are performed in a specific sequence. Each pose is designed to work on different muscle groups and help you build strength and flexibility. By practicing Sun Salutations regularly, you can burn up to 400-500 calories per hour.</p><p><h2>Warrior II Pose</h2></p><p>Another great yoga pose for weight loss is the Warrior II pose. This pose works on your thighs, hips, and core, and helps to build strength in your legs. To perform this pose, stand with your feet hip-width apart and extend your arms out to the sides. Turn your right foot out to the side and bend your right knee so that your thigh is parallel to the ground. Hold this pose for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then switch sides.</p><p><h3>Plank Pose</h3></p><p>The Plank pose is another great yoga pose for weight loss, as it works on your entire body, including your core, arms, and legs. To perform this pose, start in a push-up position, with your hands and feet shoulder-width apart. Keep your body in a straight line and hold this pose for as long as you can.</p><p><h4>Cobra Pose</h4></p><p>The Cobra pose is a great yoga pose for weight loss, as it works on your back, shoulders, and core. To perform this pose, lie on your stomach with your hands under your shoulders. Push up with your hands and lift your chest off the ground. Hold this pose for 30 seconds to 1 minute.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Best Yoga Exercise for Weight Loss at Home</h2></p><p>In conclusion, practicing yoga regularly can be a great way to lose weight and improve your overall health and well-being.
