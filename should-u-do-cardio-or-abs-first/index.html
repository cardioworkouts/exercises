Some people believe that doing cardio first will help them burn more calories, while others believe that doing abs first will help them achieve a better-looking physique. The truth is, both exercises have their benefits, and it depends on your fitness goals.</p><h2>Answering the Target of Should You Do Cardio or Abs First</h2><p>The answer to this question depends on your fitness goals. If your goal is to burn more calories, then doing cardio first is the right choice. Cardiovascular exercises like running, cycling, or swimming increase your heart rate and help you burn more calories. Doing cardio first will also warm up your body and prepare it for the next exercise.</p><p>On the other hand, if your goal is to tone your abs and achieve a better-looking physique, then doing abs first is the right choice. Doing abs first will help you activate your core muscles and improve your posture. It will also help you avoid fatigue during your workout and perform better at other exercises.</p><h2>Summary of the Article's Main Points</h2><p>In summary, whether you should do cardio or abs first depends on your fitness goals.

They improve your cardiovascular health, boost your metabolism, and reduce your risk of chronic diseases.
