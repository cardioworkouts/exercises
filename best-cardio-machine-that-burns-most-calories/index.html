Sit up straight with your feet strapped in and your knees bent.</p><p>2. Grab the handles with an overhand grip and pull them towards your chest while extending your legs.</p><p>3. Once you reach the end of the movement, reverse the motion and return to the starting position.</p><p>4. Repeat this motion for 20-30 minutes, increasing the resistance as you become more comfortable.</p><p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p><p>The rowing machine is the best cardio machine that burns the most calories due to its full-body workout capabilities.
