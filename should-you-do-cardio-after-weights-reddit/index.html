These are all common questions that people ask when trying to design an effective workout plan.</p><h3>Answer to Should You Do Cardio After Weights Reddit</h3><p>The answer to whether you should do cardio after weights Reddit depends on your fitness goals. If your primary goal is to build muscle, then doing cardio after weights may not be the best approach. This is because cardio can deplete your glycogen stores, which are necessary for muscle growth.

When I do cardio after weights, I feel like I am getting a double benefit. Not only am I building muscle and strength with my weight lifting, but I am also burning fat and improving my heart health with my cardio.</p><p>One of the main benefits of doing cardio after weights is that it can help you burn more fat. This is because weight lifting depletes your glycogen stores, which means that your body will need to burn fat for fuel during your cardio session.

One of the main drawbacks is that doing cardio after weights can be very tiring, which can make it difficult to perform at your best during your weight lifting session.

First, try to keep your cardio sessions relatively short and intense, as this will help you burn more fat and improve your cardiovascular health without exhausting yourself too much. Additionally, make sure to give yourself enough time to recover between your weight lifting and cardio sessions, as this will help you perform better during both workouts.</p><h2>Personal Experience with Cardio After Weights Reddit</h2><p>Personally, I have found that doing cardio after weights Reddit has been an effective strategy for achieving my fitness goals. I typically do about 20-30 minutes of cardio after my weight lifting sessions, and I find that this helps me burn more fat and improve my cardiovascular health without interfering with my muscle growth. Additionally, I enjoy the feeling of getting a double benefit from my workouts, and I find that doing cardio after weights helps me stay motivated and engaged.</p><h2>Question and Answer Section on Should You Do Cardio After Weights Reddit</h2><h3>Q: Can doing cardio after weights help me burn more fat?</h3><p>A: Yes, doing cardio after weights can help you burn more fat.
