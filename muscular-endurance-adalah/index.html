However, it's important to understand what it is and how you can improve it.</p><p>The target of muscular endurance adalah is to increase the amount of time that your muscles can perform a specific action without getting tired. This is different from muscular strength, which refers to the amount of force your muscles can exert in a single effort. For example, if you can lift a heavy weight for one repetition, that's an example of muscular strength. If you can perform multiple repetitions without getting tired, that's an example of muscular endurance.</p><p>In order to improve your muscular endurance, you need to engage in activities that challenge your muscles to perform repetitive contractions.
