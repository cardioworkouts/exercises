In this article, we will guide you through everything you need to know about how many cardio days when lifting.</p><h2>Pain Points Related to How Many Cardio Days When Lifting</h2><p>For individuals who love to lift weights, incorporating cardio into their routine can be a daunting task. They often wonder how much cardio they need to do to maintain their gains while still burning unwanted fat. The fear of losing muscle mass is real, and many people are skeptical about the benefits of cardio. Moreover, some individuals find it hard to balance both cardio and weightlifting in their schedule, leading to confusion about how many cardio days when lifting are required.</p><h2>Answering the Target of How Many Cardio Days When Lifting</h2><p>The answer to how many cardio days when lifting depends on your goals, your fitness level, and your schedule. If your main goal is to lose weight, then cardio can be beneficial, and you can do it 3-4 times a week. However, if you are trying to maintain muscle mass while burning fat, then you can do cardio 2-3 times a week.</p><p>It is important to remember that weightlifting should be your primary focus, and cardio should be used to supplement your weightlifting routine. Also, the intensity and duration of your cardio session should be based on your fitness level and goals.</p><h2>Summary of How Many Cardio Days When Lifting</h2><p>In summary, how many cardio days when lifting depends on your goals, fitness level, and schedule.
