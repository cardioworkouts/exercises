You may have heard conflicting advice about whether to do cardio or weights first. It can be overwhelming to decide which one should come first, but don't worry - we're here to help you figure it out.</p><h2>Pain Points</h2><p>Many people struggle with balancing cardio and weight training in their workout routine. Some people may feel like they don't have enough time to do both, while others may not know which one to prioritize. Additionally, there are different opinions online about which one should come first, making it even more confusing for beginners.</p><h2>Answer</h2><p>The answer to the question of what comes first cardio or weights ultimately depends on your fitness goals. If your goal is to improve your cardiovascular endurance or lose weight, then it's recommended to start with cardio first. However, if your goal is to build muscle and strength, then starting with weights would be more beneficial.</p><p>That being said, there are benefits to doing both cardio and weights in the same workout session. In fact, studies have shown that doing cardio before weight training can actually increase the number of calories burned during the weight training session, leading to greater overall calorie burn.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>In summary, the decision of what comes first cardio or weights depends on your fitness goals. If you're looking to improve cardiovascular endurance or lose weight, start with cardio. If you're looking to build muscle and strength, start with weights. However, doing both in the same workout can have added benefits.</p><h2>Benefits of Starting with Cardio</h2><p>Personally, I like to start my workout with cardio because it helps me get my heart rate up and gets me energized for the rest of my workout. I also find that it helps me improve my breathing technique, which is important when lifting weights. Starting with cardio also helps me warm up my muscles and prevents injury.</p><h2>Benefits of Starting with Weights</h2><p>On the other hand, I know some people who prefer to start with weights because it helps them focus on building muscle and strength. Starting with weights also allows them to lift heavier weights while their muscles are fresh, leading to better results. Additionally, starting with weights can help improve posture and balance.</p><h3>Importance of Proper Form</h3><p>Regardless of whether you start with cardio or weights, it's important to focus on proper form. This means using the correct technique and posture to avoid injury and maximize results. It's also important to start with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you get stronger.</p><h4>How to Incorporate Both into Your Workout</h4><p>If you're looking to incorporate both cardio and weights into your workout routine, there are different ways to do so. One way is to do a full-body workout that includes both cardio and weights. Another way is to split your workout into different days, with one day focusing on cardio and the other day focusing on weights.</p><h2>Personal Experience</h2><p>Personally, I like to split my workout routine into different days. I'll do cardio on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and focus on weight training on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This allows me to focus on each aspect of my fitness goals without feeling overwhelmed or burnt out.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p>Q: Can doing cardio before weight training affect my strength training performance?</p><p>A: Yes, if you do too much cardio before weight training, it can lead to fatigue and decrease your strength training performance. It's important to find a balance that works for your body.</p><p>Q: Should I do cardio and weights on the same day?</p><p>A: It depends on your fitness goals and schedule. If you have enough time and energy to do both, then it's recommended to do both in the same workout session. However, if you're short on time or prefer to focus on one aspect at a time, then splitting your workout into different days is also a good option.</p><p>Q: How much cardio should I do before weight training?</p><p>A: The amount of cardio you should do before weight training depends on your fitness level and goals. Generally, 10-20 minutes of cardio is enough to warm up your muscles and get your heart rate up before weight training.</p><p>Q: Can I do cardio and weights on an empty stomach?</p><p>A: It's not recommended to do cardio and weights on an empty stomach, as your body needs fuel to perform at its best. Eating a small snack before your workout can help give you the energy you need to power through your workout.</p><h2>Conclusion of What Comes First Cardio or Weights</h2><p>Ultimately, the decision of what comes first cardio or weights depends on your fitness goals. Whether you choose to start with cardio or weights, it's important to focus on proper form and gradually increase the intensity as you get stronger. Remember to listen to your body and find a routine that works best for you.</p></article>
