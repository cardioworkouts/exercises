Any form of physical activity that raises your heart rate and challenges your cardiovascular system can help to improve your aerobic endurance. Some other great exercises include hiking, dancing, and martial arts.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> How long does it take to see results from aerobic exercise?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> You may start to see improvements in your endurance within a few weeks of starting aerobic exercise.
