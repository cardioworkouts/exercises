This is a common dilemma that many people face when they hit the gym. Choosing between cardio and weights can be confusing, especially if you're not sure what your fitness goals are. In this article, we'll provide you with a comprehensive guide to help you decide whether you should do cardio or weights first reddit. </p><h2>Pain Points Related to Should You Do Cardio or Weights First Reddit</h2><p>When it comes to working out, you want to make the most of your time at the gym. You don't want to waste your energy on exercises that won't help you achieve your fitness goals. Therefore, it's essential to understand the pros and cons of both cardio and weights before deciding which one to do first.</p><h3>Answer to Should You Do Cardio or Weights First Reddit</h3><p>The answer to this question is not straightforward as it depends on your fitness goals. If you're someone who wants to lose weight, then cardio should be your priority. On the other hand, if you're looking to build muscle mass, then you should focus on weights first. However, if you're interested in overall fitness, then you can do either cardio or weights first. </p><h4>Summary of Main Points Related to Should You Do Cardio or Weights First Reddit</h4><p>So, the question of whether you should do cardio or weights first reddit depends on your fitness goals. If you're looking to lose weight, then start with cardio. If you're interested in building muscle mass, then weights should be your priority. However, if you're looking for overall fitness, then you can do either cardio or weights first. </p><h2>Cardio First</h2><p>When I first started working out, I was overweight and wanted to lose weight. Therefore, my trainer suggested that I start with cardio first. I followed his advice and did cardio for 30 minutes before doing any weights. I noticed that I was losing weight quickly, and my stamina was improving. </p><p>Cardio is an effective way to burn calories and improve your cardiovascular health. It's also a great warm-up exercise that prepares your body for weightlifting. However, if you're interested in building muscle mass, then doing cardio first can deplete your energy levels, which can affect your weightlifting performance. </p><h2>Weights First</h2><p>After losing weight, I wanted to build muscle mass. Therefore, my trainer suggested that I start with weights first. I followed his advice and noticed that I was gaining muscle mass quickly. Weightlifting is an effective way to build muscle mass and improve your strength. It also helps to burn calories even after your workout is over. </p><p>However, lifting weights first can be challenging, especially if you're not used to it. It can leave you feeling exhausted, which can affect your cardio performance. Therefore, it's essential to warm up before lifting weights, especially if you're a beginner. </p><h3>When to Do Cardio and Weights Together</h3><p>If you want to improve your overall fitness, then you can do cardio and weights together. However, it's essential to plan your workout routine carefully. You can either do cardio and weights on separate days or split your workout into two sessions. </p><p>If you plan to do cardio and weights together, then it's best to do cardio after weightlifting. This is because weightlifting depletes your glycogen stores, which are needed for cardio. Doing cardio after weightlifting can help to burn more fat as your body will use fat as an energy source instead of glycogen. </p><h4>How to Plan Your Workout Routine</h4><p>If you're not sure how to plan your workout routine, then it's best to consult a professional trainer. A trainer can help you create a personalized workout plan that suits your fitness goals. They can also guide you on the correct form and technique to prevent injuries. </p><h2>Question and Answer Section</h2><p><b>Q: Should I do cardio or weights first if I'm looking to lose weight?</b></p><p>A: Start with cardio first as it helps to burn calories and improve your cardiovascular health. </p><p><b>Q: Is it okay to do cardio and weights together?</b></p><p>A: Yes, you can do cardio and weights together if you plan your workout routine carefully. </p><p><b>Q: Can lifting weights first affect my cardio performance?</b></p><p>A: Yes, lifting weights first can leave you feeling exhausted, which can affect your cardio performance. </p><p><b>Q: How do I warm up before lifting weights?</b></p><p>A: You can warm up by doing some light cardio or dynamic stretching before lifting weights. </p><h2>Conclusion of Should You Do Cardio or Weights First Reddit</h2><p>So, should you do cardio or weights first reddit? The answer depends on your fitness goals. If you're looking to lose weight, then start with cardio. If you're interested in building muscle mass, then weights should be your priority.
