Let's take a closer look.</p><p>To do cardio for 2 hours, you need to have a good cardiovascular base and be able to sustain a moderate to high level of intensity for an extended period. It's also essential to have proper nutrition and hydration to prevent fatigue and optimize performance. Additionally, you should consult with a doctor if you have any underlying health conditions that may prevent you from engaging in such a demanding activity.</p><p>In summary, while it's possible to do cardio for 2 hours, it's not for everyone.
