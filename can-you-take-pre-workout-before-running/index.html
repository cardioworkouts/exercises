However, after a few weeks of taking pre workout consistently, I started to experience some negative side effects, such as jitters and difficulty sleeping at night.</p><p>After talking to my doctor and doing some research, I decided to stop taking pre workout before my runs. Instead, I focused on getting enough rest, eating a balanced diet, and staying hydrated throughout the day. While it took some time to adjust, I found that these lifestyle changes helped me feel more energized and focused during my runs without the negative side effects of pre workout.</p><h2>The Risks of Taking Pre Workout Before Running</h2><p>While pre workout can be effective for some people, it's essential to understand the potential risks and side effects.
