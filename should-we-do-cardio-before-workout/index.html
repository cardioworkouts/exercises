Overtraining can lead to injuries and fatigue, which can hinder your fitness goals. So, make sure to take rest days and listen to your body.</p><p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p><p>To sum up, should we do cardio before workout? The answer is, it depends on your fitness goals.

If your primary goal is to improve your cardiovascular endurance, then do cardio before the workout and strength training after the workout.</p><p><b>Q: What is the best time to do cardio?</b></p><p>A: It depends on your schedule and preference.
