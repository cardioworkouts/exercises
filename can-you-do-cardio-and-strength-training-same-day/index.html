On the other hand, if you're primarily interested in cardiovascular fitness, starting with cardio may be more beneficial. </p><p>It's also important to consider the specific type and intensity of each workout. For example, doing a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session followed by heavy lifting may not be the best idea, as your muscles may already be fatigued.
