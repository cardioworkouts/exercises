They target your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves, and can help you build strength and endurance in your lower body. To do a squat, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing forward.

You can start with a few seconds and gradually increase the time as you get stronger.</p><p><h4>Lunges</h4></p><p>Lunges are a great exercise for building lower body strength and improving balance and coordination. To do a lunge, stand with your feet hip-width apart and take a step forward with your right foot. Keep your back straight and your shoulders relaxed, and lower your body until your right knee is bent at a 90-degree angle. Keep your left knee hovering above the ground, and push back up to the starting position by straightening your right leg. Repeat on the other side.</p><p><h2>Jumping Jacks</h2></p><p>Jumping jacks are a simple but effective exercise that can help you improve your cardiovascular health and burn calories.
