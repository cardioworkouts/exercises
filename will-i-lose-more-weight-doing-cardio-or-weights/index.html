You may want to start with 30 minutes of cardio, such as running or cycling, three times a week. You can then add in weightlifting, such as squats, lunges, and bicep curls, two or three times a week.</p><p>It is important to vary your exercise routine to prevent boredom and to challenge your body. You may want to try different types of cardio, such as swimming or dancing, or different types of weightlifting, such as using resistance bands or kettlebells.</p><h2>Personal Experience</h2><p>I have found that incorporating both cardio and weightlifting into my exercise routine has been the most effective way to lose weight and improve my overall fitness.
